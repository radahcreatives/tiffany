              <p>Constellations in your eyes <br>
                Glory on your face <br>
                Love in your heart <br>
                It was the beauty and pulchritude wrapped around your face that drew me to you <br>
                But it was the God in you and your love for Him that kept me <br>
                Your life up until this point has been a carefully planned, intricate and divine execution of God <br>
                This day is no different <br>
                On this day, God brought a blessing into the world <br>
                There was a freshness and a liveliness that God felt we needed and decided that you were the perfect creation to quench that need and desire <br>
                The God of creation, the God of the universe, the God of the very constellations that live and float in your eyes felt that YOU were a necessity here on Earth <br>
                On this day, God birthed and brought into existence someone who would alter destinies, someone who would stand in the gap, someone who’d make the writer of this piece fall in love <br>
                The depth of your love comes from the deepest of sources <br>
                I love that because I can dive into it and not be afraid of diving into shallow love and getting hurt <br>
                You are everything God intended you to be <br>
                Your worth goes far beyond what your mind and heart is capable of comprehending <br>
                You are God’s art piece; His brilliant creation <br>
                It’s not difficult to tell that the God who created the beauty that is the universe is the same God who created you <br>
                The evidence is all over your face <br>
                If you look deep enough, you’ll find pieces of Him in your eyes <br>
                You don’t even need to search deeply to find all of Him rooted in your heart <br>
                You are God’s finest work and He is very much pleased <br>
                My prayer is that God continued enabling you to give and love without taking away from yourself <br>
                I pray that the anointing in you unlocks realms of opportunities and that your seeking of God brings to light dimensions of revelation <br>
                May you plant yourself only in places where love exists <br>
                Most importantly, I pray that our good Father can overwhelm you with thee most profound extension of joy. <br> <br>
                
                You are the best thing that’s happened to me since God found me <br>
                I love you.
